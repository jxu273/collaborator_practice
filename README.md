# collaborator_practice_again
- I'm Shikun Liu, Jiayi's collaborator.
- Here I want to introduce an interesting tool: grep. The grep command is used to search text. It searches the given file for lines containing a match to the given strings or words. It is one of the most useful commands on Linux and Unix-like system.
- Besides grep, there are also some helpful tools such as `sed` and `awk`
